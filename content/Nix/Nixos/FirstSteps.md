# Installing nix + home-manager

Determinate Systems have a really good documentation (or starting point) for nix language

[Documentation link](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer/)


```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

[MyNixos](https://mynixos.com/) is a really good website to look up how the configurations are coded.
